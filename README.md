This application allows users across the world locate and report sources of clean water near them. They can submit 
a report with details such as PPM containment, and then the application will generate a google drop map of all known water 
locations, all using JavaFX. The app will also generate a bar graph showing details of reports such as contaminant levels, 
splitting the reports based on date. 

Hopefully this app can be further extended upon and be used by people across the world.
